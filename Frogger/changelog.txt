	- Renamed loadImage() to loadBackgroundImage() because thats all its used for
- Cleaned Log.java
- Cleaned Vehicle.java

----------------------------
v0.2

- Created an array of vehicles
- Edited Vehicle class to include speed
- Fixed Vehicles moving left that wouldn't loop
- Frog can only loop screen left to right if he's on the grass

----------------------------
v0.2.1

- Set all Vehicles to be initialized in the same instance so when the frog
	collides with one vehicle, they all stop
- Cleaned up extra code
- Set up an array to hold the y values of the road lanes
	(So I don't have to keep counting pixels to reference the road lane)
- Removed unused suppress from Frogger

----------------------------
v0.3

- Edited frog.isCollidingWith to be more abstract than just logs
- Added an array to hold y values of the water lanes
- Temporarily removed log functionality as it was breaking
- Fixed Log speeds
- Allowed logs to loop depending on which direction they're going
- Fixed broken log functionality
- Fixed water threshold not being correct
- Added a break to the log collision detection
	- game was expecting frog to be on all of the logs for collision detection
	- break finds the first log frog is on and stops looking for logs
	
----------------------------
v0.4

- Added Win / Lose Conditions
- Added placeholder frame1 Image
- Edited top and bottom grass to a black border
- Added score label
- Added score functionality 
	- -50 lose
	- +50 win
- Fixed Win / Lose condition bugs
	- Losing would sometimes call gameOver() multiple times resulting
		in an extra low score
	- Winning stops all threads, but frog can still move, meaning if you
		get to the end when all the collision detection is turned off,
		you could just get infinite points
	- Winning and then hitting esc to close game ran gameWin() multiple 
		times resulting in an extra high score
	- Hitting esc to close game ran gameOver() a second time if the
		game was already lost
- Removed some unnecessary code

----------------------------
v1.0

- Added a setLocation to Frog
- Added a confirmation prompt to Esc key
- When game is over & not closed with Esc, player is prompted to input
	name and then name & score are saved to database
- For assignment purposes, all records in database logged to console
- Imported SQLite for database
- Created frogger.db

----------------------------
v1.1

- Moved GUI code in Frogger.java to its own function
- Major Frogger.java code cleanup and organization
- Fixed bug where if you didn't enter a name after the game ends,
	you'd enter a null into the database and break it
- Deleted previous records from database to clear up the nulls
